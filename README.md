## Overview

### How to use

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to draw on the screen.
- Press the shake button to reset the canvas.
- Every time the page is refreshed or the shake button is pressed, the cursor will start in a new random location

### The challenge

Create a working version of an Etch-a-Sketch

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Canvas API

### Continued development

I would definately like to add some additional interactivity to this project by perhaps adding 2 knob buttons to emulate the experience you would get on a real Etch-a-Sketch.

This project would benefit from a mobile version as well.

Currently, the stroke color changes colors as you write but the whole stroke, from start to finish changes color. I would like to closer replicate the implementation that Wes Bos has where you can see the stroke has a rainbow color affect.

### Useful resources

- [Etch-a-Sketch](https://wesbos.com/javascript/06-serious-practice-exercises/etch-a-sketch) - This tutorial was the inspiration for the project. I coded this project by myself but did reference Wes' notes a few times when I got stuck. His courses and notes are really great!

- [Traversy Media - HTML5 Canvas API Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm1QtePAYTM) - Before starting the project, I used this crash course to get up to speed with the basics of using the Canvas API.

- [MDN - Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) - Whenever I get stuck on a topic or need to research it, I always reference the MDN Web Docs. MDN's has documentation on everything JS, HTML and CSS, they are great!
